We will use the class Piazza site [{{< piazzaurl >}}]({{< piazzaurl >}}) for questions, discussion and announcements. Assignments and grades for the class will be posted to the class ELMS site: [{{< elmurl >}}]({{< elmurl >}}).
In case of an extended emergency closure, announcements on policy and procedures will be posted to Piazza.

## Textbook and Resources:


We will use the following textbooks:

- Daume (2017) _A Course in Machine Learning_ [Book Site](http://ciml.info/) 
- Leskovec, et al. (2016). _Mining of Massive Datasets_. [Book Site](http://www.mmds.org/)  
- Geron (2017) _Hands-On Machine Learning wiht Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow_. [Safari](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781491962282/)


Other readings will be posted in the [Course Calendar]({{< baseurl >}}/calendar/index.html).

## Expected outcomes and topics covered

Machine Learning methods have found their way into the modern data
analyst's toolbox. This course introduces popular methods with an
emphasis on their practical usage for data analysis. Coverage
of their statistical and computational theoretical underpinnings acquaints students with methods to evaluate statistical machine learning models
defined in terms of algorithms or function approximations.

Topics covered include: regression and prediction, tree-based methods,
overview of supervised learning theory, support vector machines,
kernel methods, ensemble methods, clustering,
visualization of large datasets, graphical models among others.

At the end of this course, students will be able to describe,
implement and analyze algorithms that solve fundamental problems in
Machine Learning. They will also be able to apply these methods to data in  variety of applications.


## Expectations for Students


### Class prep

The [Course Calendar]({{< baseurl >}}/calendar/index.html) will list
readings (uploaded to [ELMS]({{< elmurl >}})). **You are
required to read this material before lecture**

### Announcements and discussion

We will use the [Piazza page]({{< piazzaurl >}}) for class
announcements. Please use the [Piazza page]({{< piazzaurl >}}) for
*all discussion*.

### Other policies

* There will be reading assignments. Students are expected to have read the material **before** class.  
* Students are expected to attend lectures. Active participation is expected. There will be graded work done in class.  
* Students will be expected to present project progress reports and papers during class. 
* Assignments are to be handed-in electronically or in class as instructed on their due date. Late assignments will not be accepted.  
 Students may discuss homeworks and projects in groups. However, each
  student must write and/or program solutions independently.  
* Cell phone usage is **prohibited** during lecture, laptop use will be allowed to the extent that students **demonstrably** use it to follow along an in-class analysis or demonstration.  

### Grading Procedures 

* Data analysis projects (50%)  
* Written exercises (25%)  
* Final data project submission (15%)  
* Participation and discussion (10%)
