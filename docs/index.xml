You will implement approximate string matching using a seed-and-check strategy based on exact matching using the Burrows-Wheeler transform. We are providing starter code to get you going. Instructions on implementation and code are here:
https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/hcorrada/cmsc423_project4
I highly, highly recommend that you use git
To get code you will be using for this project using git:</description>

Task We will use data from the following Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments.
The goal here is to predict patients that will not show up for medical appointments based on their medical records. You should read the dataset and task prediction in Kaggle to familiarize yourself as much as possible with the task and data.

Task Due: 11/13/2018
We will be using the mortgage affordability provided by Zillow https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ to get experience with unsupervised learning methods. In particular you will use K-means clustering and two dimensionality reduction methods, one based on matrix decomposition and one based on manifold learning.

      <description>Repository The github repository for this project is at https://github.com/hcorrada/cmsc643i_timeseries. You should have received an email from github to access the repository.
You will use Keras for this project, make sure you can follow the introduction posted to the class calendar.
This project is based on examples in Ch. 6 of the Keras book linked in the course webpage.
There is a shell.ipynb notebook in the github repository. Fill that notebook to complete your project.</description>

In this first project we will implement the system described in the lecture notes for similar document searching. This project is inspired by http://mccormickml.com/2015/06/12/minhash-tutorial-with-python-code/ (Note: you can look at code there for inspiration but implement your own).
The Task We will use documents from this repository http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/tts/assessed/assessment3.html. This is a dataset of documents for which we want to find possible plagiarism.</description>

      <description>Setting up your learning system We will use Python to experiment with algorithms and datasets in the course. Follow these instructions to set it up
 Download and install Python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/
 Download and install the Anaconda scientific python distribution: https://www.continuum.io/downloads/
 You can use anaconda to manage your python environment from the terminal or using the Anaconda Navigator graphical interface. For the latter, here is a quick guide: https://docs.</description>
