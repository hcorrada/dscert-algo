You will implement approximate string matching using a seed-and-check strategy based on exact matching using the Burrows-Wheeler transform. We are providing starter code to get you going. Instructions on implementation and code are here:
https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/hcorrada/cmsc423_project4
I highly, highly recommend that you use git
To get code you will be using for this project using git:</description>

Task We will use data from the following Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments.
The goal here is to predict patients that will not show up for medical appointments based on their medical records. You should read the dataset and task prediction in Kaggle to familiarize yourself as much as possible with the task and data.

      <description>Repository The github repository for this project is at https://github.com/hcorrada/mldm_project3. You should have received an email from github to access the repository.
Part I: Introduction to Tensor Flow Follow the Introduction to Tensor Flow provided in the partI_shell.ipynb IPython notebook. Your task is to re-implement your linear SVM algorithm using gradient descent using tensor flow. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to run it on a specific dataset, as I will only look at the implementation.</description>

In this first project we will implement the system described in the lecture notes for similar document searching. This project is inspired by http://mccormickml.com/2015/06/12/minhash-tutorial-with-python-code/ (Note: you can look at code there for inspiration but implement your own).
The Task We will use documents from this repository http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/tts/assessed/assessment3.html. This is a dataset of documents for which we want to find possible plagiarism.</description>
