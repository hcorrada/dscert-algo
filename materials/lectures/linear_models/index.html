## Support Vector Machines

State-of-the-art classification and regression method

Flexible and efficient framework to learn classifers. 

--

Build upon linear methods we have discussed previously and have a nice geometric interpretation of how they are trained (based maximum margin arguments). 

---

## Support Vector Machines

Can be estimated over _similarities_ between observations (more on this later) rather than standard data in tabular form. 

E.g., applications where string similarities, or network similarities are readily available.

## Separating Hyperplanes

---

Training data: `\(\{(\mathbf{x}_1,y_1), (\mathbf{x}_2,y_2),\ldots,(\mathbf{x}_n,y_n)\}\)`


- `\(\mathbf{x}_i\)` is a vector of `\(p\)` predictor values for `\(i\)`th observation,  

- `\(y_i\)` is the class label (we're going to use +1 and -1) 

--

Build a classifier by defining
a _discriminative_ function such that

`$$b + w_1 x_{i1} + w_2 x_{i2} + \cdots + w_p x_{ip} &gt; 0 \, \mathrm{ if } y_i = +1$$`

and

`$$b + w_1 x_{i1} + w_2 x_{i2} + \cdots + w_p x_{ip} &lt; 0 \, \mathrm{ if } y_i = -1$$`

---

Points where the _discriminative_ function equals 0 form a _hyper-plane_ (i.e., a line in 2D)

`$$\{x \, : \, b + w_1 x_{1} + \cdots + w_p x_p = 0 \}$$`

.center[.image-70[![](images/9_2.png)]]

---

Hyper-plane partitions the predictor space into two sets on
each side of the line. 

Denote `\(\mathbf{w}\)` as the vector `\((w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_p)\)`

--

Restrict estimates to those for which
`\(\mathbf{w}'\mathbf{w}=\|\mathbf{w}\|^2=1\)` 

--

Then, the *signed* distance of any point
`\(x\)` to the decision boundary `\(L\)` is `\(b + \mathbf{w}'x\)`. 

---

With this we can easily
describe the two partitions as


`\begin{aligned}
L^+ &amp; =\{x:b + \mathbf{w}'x&gt;0\}, \\\\
L^{-} &amp; =\{x:b + \mathbf{w}'x&lt;0\}
\end{aligned}`


---

The `\(\mathbf{w}\)` we want as an estimate is one that separates
the training data as perfectly as possible.

--

Describe this requirement as

$$
y_i(b + \mathbf{w}'x_i) &gt; 0, i=1,\ldots,N
$$

---
layout: true

## Perceptron Algorithm

---

Algorithm to find vector `\(\mathbf{w}\)` that
satisfies the separation requirement as much as possible. 

Penalize `\(\mathbf{w}\)` by how far into the wrong side misclassified
points are:

`$$D(b, \mathbf{w}) = - \sum_{i\in \mathcal{M}} y_i (b + \mathbf{w}'x_i)$$`

`\(\mathcal{M}\)`: set of points misclassified  by `\(\mathbf{w}\)` (on the wrong side of the
hyper-plane).

---


Estimate `\(\mathbf{w}\)` by minimizing `\(D\)`. 

_How do we do this??_

## Tangent: Why do we use means so much in Data Science?

---

Suppose I get some dataset for analysis, the first thing I do is to use Exploratory Data Analysis to get a sense of what this data looks like.

One purpose of EDA is to spot problems in data (as part of data wrangling) and understand variable properties like:

- central trends 
- spread 
- skew
- suggest possible modeling strategies (e.g., probability distributions)

Turns out we can be a bit more formal about why the mean of the data makes sense as an estimate of central tendency

## Math Review: Gradients

---

Gradients are a generalization of the derivative for vectors

Their role in optimization is similar to what we saw in the proof to the previous claim

For example: if we want to find the minimum of a function, find a point where gradient is 0

---

Suppose function `\(f: \mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R}\)`

Takes vector `\(x=\langle x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_p \rangle\)` as input

The gradient of `\(f\)` is the vector where `\(j\)`th entry is the
derivative of `\(f\)` with respect to `\(x_j\)`.

`$$\nabla_x f = \left\langle \frac{\partial f}{x_1}, \ldots \frac{\partial f}{x_p}\right\rangle$$`
---

Consider the following function

`$$f(\mu) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \| x_i - \mu \|^2$$`

_Quiz_: Write the gradient `\(\nabla_{\mu} f\)`

---

For now we will use two important properties of the gradient:

- `\(\nabla_x f (x^*)= \mathbf{0}\)` is a necessary (not sufficient) condition for vector `\(x^*\)` to be an optimizer of `\(f\)`

- `\(\nabla_x f(x^*)\)` gives the direction of **steepest ascent** of function `\(f\)` at point `\(x^*\)`

---
layout: true 

## Optimization with gradients

---

Let's use these properties to concoct an optimization method: _gradient descent_

--

Given function `\(f\)` to _minimize_

- Start at some arbitrary vector `\(z\)`
- Repeat until done:
  - Find the direction of _steepest descent_: `\(-\nabla_x f(z)\)`
  - Update `\(z\)` by moving in that direction

Consider the linear regression (least squares problem): Given dataset 
`\(\langle x_1, y_1 \rangle, \ldots, \langle x_n, y_n \rangle\)`, where outcomes `\(y_i\)` are _continuous_.

Suppose we want to model outcome `\(Y\)` as a linear function of `\(X\)`:

`$$Y = b + \mathbf{w}'x$$`

--

_Quiz_ Sketch gradient descent algorithm to minimize squared error loss

`$$L(b, \mathbf{w}) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^N \left[ y_i - (b + \mathbf{w}'x_i)\right]^2$$`

---
layout: true

## Perceptron Algorithm

---

Algorithm to find vector `\(\mathbf{w}\)` that
satisfies the separation requirement as much as possible. 

Penalize `\(\mathbf{w}\)` by how far into the wrong side misclassified
points are:

`$$D(b, \mathbf{w}) = - \sum_{i\in \mathcal{M}} y_i (b + \mathbf{w}'x_i)$$`

`\(\mathcal{M}\)`: set of points misclassified  by `\(\mathbf{w}\)` (on the wrong side of the
hyper-plane).

---

Assuming `\(\mathcal{M}\)` is fixed, the gradient of `\(D\)` is

`$$\nabla_{\mathbf{w}} D  = -\sum_{i\in \mathcal{M}} y_i x_i$$`

and

`$$\nabla_b D = -\sum_{i \in \mathcal{M}} y_i$$`

---

Perceptron algorithm uses *stochastic gradient descent*: 

- Initialize parameters `\(b\)` and `\(\mathbf{w}\)`
- Cycle through training points `\(i\)`, if it is misclassified, update parameters as

$$
\mathbf{w} \leftarrow \mathbf{w} + \eta y_ix_i
$$

and

$$
b \leftarrow b + \eta y_i
$$

- Stop when converged (or get tired of waiting)

_This is gradient descent_!

---

There are a few problems with this algorithm:

If there exists `\(b\)` and `\(\mathbf{w}\)` that separates the training points perfectly, 

--

then there are an infinite number of `\(b\)` and `\(\mathbf{w}\)`s that also separate the data perfectly

---

Algorithm will converge in a finite number of steps if the training data is separable

--

However, the number of finite steps can be *very* large

---

When the training data is *not* separable, the algorithm will not converge.

---
layout: true

## Support Vector Machines

---

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are designed to directly
address these problems. 

---
class: split-50

.column[A central concept in SVMs that we did not see in logistic regression is **the margin**: the distance between the separating plane and its nearest datapoints.]

.column[
.image-90[![](images/9_3.png)]
]

---

When the data are separable, SVMs will choose the single
optimal `\(\mathbf{w}\)` that _maximizes_ the distance between the decision
boundary and the closest point in each class.

--

Why is this a good idea?

---
exclude: true

SVMs are designed from three _key insights_:

1. **Look for the maximum margin hyper-plane**
2. Only depend on pair-wise "similarities" of observations
3. Only depend on a subset of observations (support vectors)



Let's see these in turn.

---

## Maximum margin hyper-planes

Goal: find the hyper-plane  that separates training data with largest margin. 

This will tend to _generalize_ better since new observations have room to fall within margin and still be classified correctly. 

---
layout: true
## Maximum margin hyper-planes

---

This can be cast as _optimization_ problem:

$$
\mathrm{max}_{b,\mathbf{w}} M \\\\
\mathrm{s.t.} \|\mathbf{w}\|^2 = 1 \\\\
y_i(b + \mathbf{w}'x_i) \geq M \, \forall i
$$


---

Rewrite optimization problem setting `\(M=1/\|\mathbf{w}\|^2\)` and using a little bit of algebra (see CIML):

$$
\mathrm{min}_{b, \mathbf{w}} \frac{1}{2} \| \mathbf{w} \|^2 \\\\
\mathrm{s.t.} y_i(b + \mathbf{w}'x_i) \geq 1 \, \forall i
$$

---

$$
\mathrm{min}_{b, \mathbf{w}} \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{w}\|^2 \\\\
\mathrm{s.t.} y_i(b + \mathbf{w}'x_i) \geq 1 \, \forall i
$$

This is a _constrained_ optimization problem

Minimize the norm of `\(\mathbf{w}\)` under the constraint that it classifies every observation correctly. 

---
exclude: true

We can switch between equivalent constrained minimization and constrained maximization problems. 

In the maximum-margin hyper-plane case, the equivalent constrained maximization problem (the _dual_ problem) is:

`$$\mathrm{max}_{\alpha} \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_i - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^N \alpha_i \alpha_k y_i y_k x_i'x_k \\\\
\mathrm{s.t.} \alpha_i \geq 0 \, \forall i$$`

---
exclude: true

## Maximum margin hyper-planes

`$$\mathrm{max}_{\alpha} \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_i - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^N \alpha_i \alpha_k y_i y_k x_i'x_k \\\\
\mathrm{s.t.} \alpha_i \geq 0 \, \forall i$$`

This quadratic optimization problem is usually easier to optimize than the original problem (notice there is only positivity constraints on `\(\alpha\)`).

---
exclude: true

## Support Vector Machines

_Key insight no. 2_: **SVMs only depend on pairwise "similarity" functions of observations**

`$$\mathrm{max}_{\alpha} \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_i - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^N \alpha_i \alpha_k y_i y_k x_i'x_k \\\\
\mathrm{s.t.} \alpha_i = 0 \, \forall i$$`

Only inner products between observations are required as opposed to the observations themselves.

---
exclude: true

## Support Vector Machines


Also, we can write the _discriminant_ function in equivalent form

`$$f(x) = \beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n y_i \alpha_i x'x_i$$`



Geometrically, we can think of the inner product between observations as a "similarity" measure. 



Therefore, we can fit these models with other measures that works as "similarities". 

---
exclude: true

## Support Vector Machines

_Key insight no. 3_: **SVMs only depend on a subset of observations (support vectors)**

Optimial solutions `\(\beta\)` and `\(\alpha\)` must satisfy the following condition:

$$
\alpha_i [ y_i(\beta_0 + \beta'x_i) -1] = 0 \, \forall i.
$$

---
exclude: true

## Support Vector Machines

$$
\alpha_i [ y_i(\beta_0 + \beta'x_i) -1] = 0 \, \forall i.
$$

Case 1: `\(\alpha_i &gt; 0\)`, then the signed distance between observation `\(x_i\)` and the decision boundary is 1. 

This means that observation `\(x_i\)` is _on the margin_

---
exclude: true

## Support Vector Machines

$$
\alpha_i [ y_i(\beta_0 + \beta'x_i) -1] = 0 \, \forall i.
$$

Case 2: `\(y_i (\beta_0 + \beta'x_i) &gt; 1\)`, then observation `\(x_i\)` is not on the margin and `\(\alpha_i=0\)`.

---
exclude: true

## Support Vector Machines

To define the discriminant function in terms of `\(\alpha\)`s we only need observations that are _on the margin_, 

i.e., those for which `\(\alpha_i &gt; 0\)`. 



These are called _support vectors_. 



Also implies we only need Support Vectors to make predictions.

.column[![](images/9_6.png)]

---
class: split-30

## Non-separable data

The solution is to penalize observations on the **wrong side of the margin** by introducing _slack variables_ to the optimization problem.


`$$\mathrm{min}_{\beta_0,\beta,\xi} \; C\sum_{i=1}^N \xi_i + \frac{1}{2} \|\beta\|^2 \\\\
\mathrm{s.t} \; y_i(\beta_0 + \beta'x_i) \geq 1 - \xi_i \, \forall i \\\\
\xi_i \geq 0 \, \forall i$$`

## Non-separable data

`$$\mathrm{min}_{b,\mathbf{w},\xi} \; C\sum_{i=1}^N \xi_i + \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{w}\|^2 \\\\
\mathrm{s.t} \; y_i(b + \mathbf{w}'x_i) \geq 1 - \xi_i \, \forall i \\\\
\xi_i \geq 0 \, \forall i$$`

`\(C\)` is a parameter that tradeoffs the width of the margin vs. the penalty on observations on the _wrong_ side of the margin.

## Non-separable data

An elegant result is that this formulation doesn't change the dual problem we saw before very much:

`$$\mathrm{max}_{\alpha} \; \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_i - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^N \alpha_i \alpha_k y_i y_k x_i'x_k \\\\
\mathrm{s.t.} \; 0 \leq \alpha_i \leq C \, \forall i$$`

---
exclude: true

## Non-separable data

Only need support vectors, where `\(\alpha_i &gt; 0\)` to define the discriminant function and make predictions. 


The smaller the cost parameter `\(C\)`, the learned SVM will have fewer support vectors. 


Think of the number of support vectors as a rough measure of the _complexity_ of the SVM obtained.

## The SVM as a regularized estimation method

We can't apply gradient descent yet...

The SVM problem is equivalent to the following optimization problem with `\(\lambda = 1/C\)`

`$$\mathrm{min}_{b, \mathbf{w}} \; \sum_{i=1}^N (1-y_if_i)_+ + \frac{\lambda}{2} \|\mathbf{w}\|^2$$`

- `\(f_i = b + \mathbf{w}'x_i\)`
- `\((1-y_if_i)_+\)` denoting the _positive part_ of `\(1-y_if_i\)`.

## The SVM as a regularized estimation method

`$$\mathrm{min}_{b, \mathbf{w}} \; \sum_{i=1}^N (1-y_if_i)_+ + \frac{\lambda}{2} \|\mathbf{w}\|^2$$`

If observation `\(x_i\)` is on the proper side of the margin, 

then `\(y_if_i &gt; 1\)` and thus `\((1-y_ifi)_+ = 0\)`. 

--

Otherwise, `\((1-y_if_i)_+\)` equals the signed distance to the margin for observation `\(x_i\)`.

## The SVM as a regularized estimation method

`$$\mathrm{min}_{b, \mathbf{w}} \; \sum_{i=1}^N (1-y_if_i)_+ + \frac{\lambda}{2} \|\mathbf{w}\|^2$$`

This formulation makes the connection to SVMs as regularized estimation procedure much clearer. 

--

The first term corresponds to a "loss function"

--

The second term a regularization term that controls model complexity.

## Regularized Loss

---

This is a general framework we will see in many algorithms.

We write the models we are learning as solutions to _optimization_ problems with _regularized_ objective functions

`$$f = \arg \max_f L(y, f) + \lambda R(f)$$`

- `\(L(y,f)\)` is a loss function, e.g., `\(\sum_{i=1}^N (1-y_if_i)_+\)`  
- `\(R(f)\)` is a _regularizer_, e.g., `\(\|\mathbf{w}\|^2\)`

---

Other loss functions:

- Zero/one loss: `\(L(y,f)=\mathbf{1}[yf \leq 0]\)`
- Hinge: `\(L(y,f)=(1-yf)_+\)`
- Logistic: `\(L(y,f) = \frac{1}{\log 2} \log (1+\exp{-yf})\)`
- Exponential: `\(L(y,f) = \exp{-yf}\)`
- Squared: `\(L(y,f) = (y-f)^2\)`

The reason we like this is that now we have tons of flexibility in learning models

We can apply gradient descent to our loss and regularizer of choice as appropriate to specific application

## Support Vector Machines

Different algorithms depending on data size

  - Massive number of examples with few predictors, train with stochastic gradient descent 
  
  - Moderate number of examples, use quadratic optimization (later in semester)
  
  - For quadratic version, can subset observations that could be support vectors

## Support Vector Machines

State-of-the-art for many applications

We will see later that makign this a non-linear model is very powerful and straightforward

Very elegant formulation serves as springboard to understand many models
