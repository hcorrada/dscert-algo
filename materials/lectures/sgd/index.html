## Feed-forward Neural Networks

We will present the feed-forward neural network formulation for a general case where we are modeling `\(K\)` outcomes `\(Y_1,\ldots,Y_k\)` as `\(f_1(X),\ldots,f_K(X)\)`. 

---

## Feed-forward Neural Networks

In multi-class classification, categorical outcome may take multiple values

We consider `\(Y_k\)` as a discriminant function for class `\(k\)`, 

Final classification is made using `\(\arg \max_k Y_k\)`. For regression, we can take `\(K=1\)`.

---

## Feed-forward Neural Networks

A single layer feed-forward neural network is defined as

`$$h_m = g_h(\mathbf{w}_{1m}'X), \; m=1,\ldots,M \\\
f_k = g_{fk}(\mathbf{w}_{2k}'\mathbf{h}),\; k=1,\ldots,K$$`

Function `\(g_f\)` used in the output layer depends on the outcome modeled. 

For classification a _soft-max_ function can be used `\(g_{fk}(t_k) = \frac{e^{t_k}}{\sum_{l=1}^K e^{t_k}}\)` where `\(t_k=\mathbf{w}_{2k}'\mathbf{h}\)`. 

For regression, we may take `\(g_{fk}\)` to be the identify function.

## Feed-forward Neural Networks


The single-layer feed-forward neural network has the same parameterization as the PPR model, 

Activation functions `\(g_h\)` are much simpler, as opposed to, e.g., smoothing splines as used in PPR.

.column[
The general form of feed-forward network can be extended by adding additional _hidden layers_.
]

---

.column[
Empirically, it is found that by using more, thinner, layers, better expected prediction error is obtained.

However, each layer introduces more non-linearity into the network.

Making optimization markedly more difficult.
]

---

.column[
We may interpret hidden layers as progressive derived representations of the input data.

Since we train based on a loss-function, these derived representations should make modeling the outcome of interest progressively easier.

.column[
In many applications, these derived representations are used for model interpretation.

## Stochastic Gradient Descent

---

Other learning methods we have seen, like mixture models and SVMs are **optimization problems** 

We can design gradient-descent based optimization algorithms that process  data efficiently.

We will use linear regression as a case study of how this insight would work.

---
layout: true

### Case Study

---

Let's use linear regression with one predictor, no intercept as a case study.

**Given**: Training set `\(\{(x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)\}\)`, with continuous response `\(y_i\)` and single predictor `\(x_i\)` for the `\(i\)`-th observation.

**Do**: Estimate parameter `\(w\)` in model `\(y=wx\)` to solve

`$$\min_{w} L(w) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - w x_i)^2$$`

---
class: split-50

.column[Suppose we want to fit this model to the following (simulated) data:]

.column[
![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

---
class: split-50

.column[Our goal is then to find the value of `\(w\)` that minimizes mean squared error. This corresponds to finding one of these many possible lines.]

.column[Each of which has a specific error for this dataset:]


.column[
![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

---

Insights:

1) As we saw before in class, loss is minimized when the derivative of the loss function is 0

2) and, the derivative of the loss (with respect to `\(w\)` ) at a given estimate `\(w\)` suggests new values of `\(w\)` with smaller loss!

---
class: split-40

.column[Let's take a look at the derivative:

`$$\frac{\partial}{\partial w} L(w) = \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial w} \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - w x_i)^2 \\
{} = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - w x_i) (-x_i)$$`

## Gradient Descent

---

This is what motivates the Gradient Descent algorithm

1. Initialize `\(w=\mathrm{normal(0,1)}\)`
2. Repeat until convergence
  - Set `\(w = w + \eta \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f(x_i)) x_i\)`
  

---

The basic idea is to move the current estimate of `\(w\)` in the direction that minimizes loss the *fastest*. 

---
class: split-50

.column[Let's run GD and track what it does:]

.column[




![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-.gif)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

"Batch" gradient descent: take a step (update `\(w\)`) by calculating derivative with respect to _all_ `\(n\)` observations in our dataset. 


`$$w = w + \eta \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f(x_i, w)) x_i$$`

where `\(f(x_i) = w x_i\)`.

---

For multiple predictors (e.g., adding an intercept), this generalizes to the _gradient_ 


$$
\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{w} + \eta \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{w})) \mathbf{x}_i
$$

where `\(f(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{w}) = w_0 + w_1 x_{i1} + \cdots + w_p x_{ip}\)`

---

Gradiest descent falls within a family of optimization methods called _first-order methods_ (first-order means they use derivatives only). These methods have properties amenable to use with very large datasets:

1. Inexpensive updates    
2. "Stochastic" version can converge with few sweeps of the data  
3. "Stochastic" version easily extended to streams  
4. Easily parallelizable  

Drawback: Can take many steps before converging

layout: true

## Stochastic Gradient Descent

---

**Key Idea**: Update parameters using update equation _one observation at a time_:

1. Initialize `\(\beta=\mathrm{normal}(0,\sqrt{p})\)`, `\(i=1\)`
2. Repeat until convergence
  - For `\(i=1\)` to `\(n\)`
    - Set `\(w = w + \eta (y_i - f(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{w})) \mathbf{x}_i\)`

Why does SGD make sense?

For many problems we are minimizing a cost function of the type

$$
\arg \min_f \frac{1}{n} \sum_i L(y_i,f_i) + \lambda R(f)
$$
Which in general has gradient

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_i \nabla_f L(y_i,f_i) + \lambda \nabla_f R(f)
$$

---

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_i \nabla_f L(y_i,f_i) + \lambda \nabla_f R(f)
$$

The first term looks like an empirical estimate (average) of the gradient at `\(f_i\)`

SGD then uses updates provided by a different _estimate_ of the gradient based on a single point.

- Cheaper
- Potentially unstable

---

In practice

- Mini-batches: use ~100 or so examples at a time to estimate gradients
- Shuffle data order every pass (epoch)

---

This still presents challenges:

- Choosing proper learning rate
- How to update learning rate as iterations increase
- Per-parameter learning rates 
- Avoiding local minima

--

We will see modern derivatives of SGD that can address some of these challenges

Updates based on exponentially decaying average of past squared gradients (for adaptation)

And past gradients (for momentum)

- Stabilize by aggregating estimates of gradients
